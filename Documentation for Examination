Explanation for the Script:

A script that helps install a master and slave Ubuntu vagrant machine.
And also runs LAMP stack


Must have:

-vagrant
-virtual box

(This must be present in the machine that is running this script)



slave & master:
	memory: 1024
	cpus: 2
	
	

Slave machine:

name = slave_1
image = ubuntu/focal64
network:
	private_network
	constant ip: "192.168.57.0" (change_this to what that can be used on your bare metal)
	
Slave configuration:
	update & upgrade machine
	
	install:
		- switching the passowrd authenticator on to log in using password
		- installing avahi-daemon libnss-mdns
		
Master machine

name = master
image = ubuntu/focal64
network:
	private_network
	constant ip: "192.168.56.0" (change_this to what that can be used on your bare metal)


Master configuration:
	update & upgrade machine
	
	install:
		- restarting the sshd service
		- installing avahi-daemon libnss-mdns
		
		
script configuration:
	this script will install:
		
		

LAMP stack (slave & master installation):
	LAMP: (linux, apache, mysql & php):
	- Installing MySQL
	- Installing Apache2 Web Server
	- Installing PHP & Requirements
	- Enabling Modules
	- Restarting Apache
	
	
	
Finally, from the script a LAMP stack will be installed on both master and slave as soon as the script executes. 
A restart will take effect for the apache server after the installation and configuration.
Different versions of php will be installed because some servers require more recent versions of PHP.
Also MySQL server and client are going to be installed on both Master and Slave.


Still on this script, a direct clone from PHP application from github and the installation of other packages.
	install:
		-composer
		-curl
		

Using Ansible playbook
	-ansible.cfg default configuration file for ansible
	-site.yaml where our playbook is going to be present.
	-inventory where your ip address is held.
	
cronjob creation
	-present in the site.yaml checking uptime of the server every 12 am.
